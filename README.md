# ScentAI: Advanced Olfactory Recognition and Analysis

## Overview
ScentAI was an innovative project designed to revolutionize how machines interpret and understand scents. By leveraging cutting-edge electronic nose technology coupled with sophisticated machine learning models, ScentAI not only identified specific scents it had been trained on but also adeptly determined which known scent any untrained scent was closest to. Trained on an extensive dataset that included the full range of products from the top 20 cologne and perfume brands, Bath & Body Works aromas, and more, ScentAI mastered the detection and classification of a diverse palette of fragrance notes, such as woody, vanilla, citrus, floral, musk, aquatic, spicy, fruity, green, and gourmand, among hundreds of others.

## Hardware Configuration
The project's success was underpinned by:

- **Electronic Nose (E-Nose)**: A sophisticated device equipped with a comprehensive sensor array to capture volatile organic compounds characteristic of various scents.
- **Data Acquisition System**: Precisely captured and digitized the sensor array's output, allowing for detailed analysis of each scent profile.
- **Computational Resources**: High-performance computing systems with advanced GPUs facilitated the processing of complex datasets and the execution of deep learning models.

## Machine Learning Model
ScentAI employed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) tailored for olfactory data processing, which excelled in:

- **Adaptive Recognition**: Beyond identifying trained scents, the model adeptly pinpointed the closest match for new scents, providing valuable insights even in uncharted olfactory territory.
- **Diverse Note Spectrum**: The model was trained on a dataset representative of a vast spectrum of scents, including not just woody and vanilla but also citrus, floral, musk, aquatic, spicy, fruity, green, gourmand, and hundreds of others.

## Project Milestones
- **Robust Scent Database**: Amassed and processed a vast collection of scent samples, creating a comprehensive database that spanned a wide array of fragrance notes.
- **Precision and Versatility**: Achieved high precision in scent detection and classification, with the capability to identify the closest known scent for unfamiliar samples.
- **Real-Time Analysis Capability**: Ensured ScentAI could perform real-time scent analysis, providing immediate feedback on detected fragrances.

## Getting Involved with ScentAI

1. **Data Enrichment**: Continued efforts to expand the scent database with new samples, enhancing the model's recognition capabilities.
   
2. **Algorithm Optimization**: Refined the CNN model for greater accuracy and efficiency, adapting to the complexities of scent analysis.

3. **Field Application and Testing**: Deployed ScentAI across various settings for real-world testing, fine-tuning its functionality based on feedback and findings.

## Contributions to ScentAI

ScentAI benefited from a collaborative development approach, welcoming contributions that ranged from expanding the scent database to refining the machine learning algorithms and enhancing the analytical features for end users.
